# Ft_printf
PRINTF is a 42 Project that aims to mimic libc printf function. One of the goals of this project is to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: variadic functions.

You have to implement the following conversions:
1- %c Prints a single character.
2- %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
3- %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
4- %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
5- %i Prints an integer in base 10.
6- %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
7- %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
